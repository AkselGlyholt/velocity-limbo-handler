## About
VelocityLimboHandler is a simple yet powerful **Velocity proxy plugin** that manages player fallback handling when a server becomes unavailable. Instead of leaving players stranded in Limbo, it systematically reconnects them to their last known server or a designated lobby.

- **Queue-based Reconnection** ‚Äì Ensures players are reconnected in an orderly manner.
- **Customizable** ‚Äì Configure the limbo and fallback settings to fit your needs.
- **Supports Any Limbo Server** ‚Äì Optimized for [LOOHP's Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo), but adaptable to others.

## Installation
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/AkselGlyholt/velocity-limbo-handler/releases/latest).
2. Place it in the `plugins` folder of your **Velocity proxy**.
3. Restart the proxy to generate the configuration files.
4. Configure the **proxy, Limbo server, and plugin** as needed.
5. Restart the proxy once again.

**Important:** To prevent exploits, it's recommended to disable the `/server` command inside the config, or using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) with **context-based permissions**.

`plugins/velocity-limbo-handler/config.yml`

## Setting Up the Proxy & Limbo  
VelocityLimboHandler does not provide a built-in fallback system, so you'll need to configure your Velocity proxy to send players to Limbo when their target server is unavailable.

**Example Proxy Configuration (try orders):**
```toml
[servers]
  try = ["default", "limbo"]
```

**Example Using Forced Hosts:**
```toml
[forced-hosts]
  "build.example.com" = ["build", "limbo"]
  "pvp.example.com" = ["pvp", "limbo"]
```
