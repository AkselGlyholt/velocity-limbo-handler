# What's this?
This is a velocity plugin for standalone Limbo servers under your network.
It handles automatic reconnecting to the players previous server or to the lobby server.

It handles reconnection with a queue, so players return in a systematic order, so no players get stuck in the limbo server forever

I developed this plugin to work with [Limbo by LOOHP](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo), but it should work with any Limbo server. But you might have to set up your limbo server differently depending on how it handles players and reconnection.


# Installation
Simply download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/akselglyholt/velocity-limbo-handler)
Then drag it into your velocity plugins folder, **NOT ON YOUR BACKEND SERVER!**

Now edit the config to your liking
