## 🎯 About  
VelocityLimboHandler is a simple yet powerful **Velocity proxy plugin** that manages player fallback handling when a server becomes unavailable. Instead of leaving players stranded in Limbo, it systematically reconnects them to their last known server or a designated lobby.  

- 🔹 **Queue-based Reconnection** – Ensures players are reconnected in an orderly manner.  
- 🔹 **Customizable** – Configure the limbo and fallback settings to fit your needs.  
- 🔹 **Supports Any Limbo Server** – Optimized for [LOOHP's Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo), but adaptable to others.

## 📥 Installation  
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/AkselGlyholt/velocity-limbo-handler/releases/latest).  
2. Place it in the `plugins` folder of your **Velocity proxy**.  
3. Restart the proxy to generate the configuration files.  
4. Configure the **proxy, Limbo server, and plugin** as needed.  
5. Restart the proxy once again.  

**🔹 Important:** To prevent exploits, it's recommended to disable the `/server` command inside the Limbo server using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) with **context-based permissions**.

## ⚙️ Configuration  
After installation, configure the plugin via:  
📂 `plugins/velocity-limbo-handler/config.yml`  

### 🔹 **Required Settings:**  
✅ **`limbo-name`** (default: `Limbo`) – Name of the Limbo server in Velocity.  
✅ **`direct-connect-server`** (default: `default`) – The server where direct connections should be sent.  

### 🔹 **Optional Settings:**  
🔄 **`task-interval`** (default: `3`) – Time (seconds) between connection attempts.  
🔔 **`queue-notify-interval`** (default: `30`) – How often players are notified of their queue position.

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Proxy & Limbo  
VelocityLimboHandler does not provide a built-in fallback system, so you'll need to configure your Velocity proxy to send players to Limbo when their target server is unavailable.  

**Example Proxy Configuration (try orders):**  
```toml
[servers]
  try = ["default", "limbo"]
```
  
**Example Using Forced Hosts:**  
```toml
[forced-hosts]
  "build.example.com" = ["build", "limbo"]
  "pvp.example.com" = ["pvp", "limbo"]
```
